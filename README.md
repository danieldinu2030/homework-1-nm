# MATLAB Assignment - Matrix Numerical Methods

## Overview

The first and most complex Numerical Methods assignment features three different tasks with a thouroughly explained 
solving process and a collection of MATLAB functions to perform specific pieces of this process. All tasks focus on real life
applications of numerical methods for matrices.

The three areas of interest for this project are: <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">Markov Chains</a> , 
<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression">Linear Regression</a> and 
<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database">MNIST</a>.

## Tasks

The three tasks have their own directory, containing:

- A `README.md` file which explains the numerical method and the set of necessary MATLAB functions
- The aforementioned set of MATLAB functions (mostly compatible with GNU Octave as well)
- A file containing the necessary input for testing
- A wrapper MATLAB function that correctly calls the others to completely solve the task
